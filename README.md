# ShadowTrace 🛡️  
### AI-Powered Digital Footprint Correlation & DPDP Compliance Suite  

Developed for **HackWithAI 2026** at **KLH University (Bachupally Campus), Hyderabad**.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

ShadowTrace is an advanced OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) platform built during a 24-hour hackathon to solve **Problem Statement #64: Aggregate & Correlate Identifiers**.

In today’s data-driven world, personal identifiers are scattered across platforms and frequently exposed in breaches. ShadowTrace enables users and privacy professionals to:

- Aggregate fragmented digital identifiers  
- Detect exposed Personally Identifiable Information (PII)  
- Visualize digital footprint exposure  
- Map violations directly to the **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023**

The system combines asynchronous intelligence gathering, AI-powered detection, and automated legal mapping into a unified compliance dashboard.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 Deep Identity Correlation  
Asynchronous scrapers aggregate identifiers (emails, usernames) from multiple public platforms and unify them into a single correlated digital profile.

### 🌐 Interactive Identity Graph  
Dynamic visualization engine inspired by graph-based network modeling. The "Root Node" connects to exposure points across platforms for intuitive analysis.

### 🤖 AI-Driven PII Detection  
Pattern recognition and structured detection logic identify:
- Aadhaar Numbers  
- PAN Numbers  
- Email Addresses  
- Private Keys  
- Sensitive Tokens  

### ⚖️ DPDP Act (2023) Compliance Auditor  
Automated mapping engine that flags potential violations under:
- Section 6 (Consent)  
- Section 8 (Security Safeguards)  

Includes a built-in risk scoring system.

### 🧭 Secure Operator Dashboard  
High-performance modern interface optimized for rapid auditing and analysis.

## 🧠 Architecture Summary

ShadowTrace follows a modular architecture:

1. Async Scraper Engine → Collects OSINT data  
2. Correlation Engine → Links identifiers  
3. PII Detection Layer → Detects sensitive information  
4. DPDP Compliance Engine → Maps violations  
5. Visualization Layer → Graph-based UI  

This separation ensures scalability, maintainability, and real-time performance.
